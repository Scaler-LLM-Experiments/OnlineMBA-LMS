## Group Assignments

Group assignments require collaboration with other students and include additional steps.

### Step 1: Group Formation

**For FIRST-TIME Submission (Active Tab):**

**✅ Good News: Your group is automatically formed!**

When you open a group assignment for the first time, the system **automatically fills**:

1. **Group Name** (Auto-filled):
   - Automatically set based on your subject grouping
   - Example: "Group A", "Team 1", "Section B"
   - This is pulled from admin-configured grouping in the system
   - **You can change it if needed** by typing a new name

2. **Group Members** (Auto-selected):
   - Your group members are **automatically selected** (checkboxes already ticked)
   - Based on your batch, subject, and group assignment
   - All students in your group will be pre-selected
   - **Important**: You won't see your own name in the list (you're automatically included)
   - **You can add or remove members** if needed by checking/unchecking boxes

**How to Modify Pre-filled Group (if needed):**
- **Change Group Name**: Simply type a new name in the field
- **Add Member**: Click on the dropdown, search by name/roll number, and select
- **Remove Member**: Click the X on their chip or uncheck their checkbox

**For VIEWING or UPDATING Submission (Completed Tab):**

- ✅ **Group name is shown** - from your previous submission
- ✅ **Group members are shown** - checkboxes show who you submitted with
- You can modify them during updates (only before deadline)

**Important Notes:**
- Group is auto-formed based on **admin configuration in "Group Members" sheet**
- If you see wrong members pre-selected, contact your instructor (may be configuration issue)
- Only ONE person in the group should create the INITIAL submission (even though everyone sees the same pre-filled group)
- The person creating the submission is automatically included (that's why you don't see yourself in the dropdown)
- Other group members will see the submission when they open the assignment in "Completed" tab
- All group members must be from the same batch

### Step 2: Complete Assignment Content

1. **Answer All Questions**: Fill in the required answers
2. **Upload Files**: Add any required attachments
3. **Group Member List**: Review the list of selected group members before proceeding

### Step 3: Peer Ratings (Optional During Submission)

If peer ratings are enabled for the assignment:

**During Initial Submission (Active Tab):**
- Peer ratings CAN be filled now OR after submission is made
- You'll see a section titled "Peer Rating & Remarks (Can be filled now or once submission is made)"
- You can choose to:
  - **Fill now**: Rate all your group members with remarks before submitting
  - **Fill later**: Skip this section and fill it after submission (even after deadline)

**Important Note Displayed:**
> ⚠️ Important: Peer ratings are mandatory. You must rate ALL group members with remarks to submit this assignment. Once submitted, ratings cannot be edited. Ratings can also be filled once the assignment deadline is expired.

**If you choose to fill ratings during submission:**
- If you start rating anyone, you must provide remarks for them
- You can rate some members or all members
- Partial ratings are allowed during initial submission

1. **File Naming**

   - Convert files if necessary before uploading
   - Compress large files if possible

   - Don't rely on countdown alone - note the actual deadline
   - Account for time zone differences if any

4. **After Deadline**
   - Cannot submit or update after deadline passes
   - Plan accordingly and don't miss it
   - Contact instructor immediately if you miss deadline
   - Peer ratings can still be completed after deadline

     - ❌ "Lazy and didn't do anything"
     - ❌ "Best person ever, 10/10"

4. **Honesty and Integrity**

   - Don't rate based on friendship
   - Reflect actual contribution accurately
